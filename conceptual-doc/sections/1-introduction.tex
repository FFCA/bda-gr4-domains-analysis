Domain information can change fast due to various reasons such as changes in ownership, the provider as well as of the servers or their locations.
Keeping track of these changes and provide current analyses in the field of related businesses areas require the establishment of processes and strategies for information retrieval, processing, loading, and deployment.
Each of these steps should be realized using state-of-the-art techniques and technologies to enable continuous usage of the product.
Quality measures like code versioning and documentation are fundamental requirements that meet this demand.
This project aims at offering these characteristics and apply them to the field of big data analyses in the topic of domain information retrieved from DNS records.
